"""XLA Profiler will help you debug and optimize training workload performance for your models using Cloud TPU
performance tools.

Manual capture via TensorBoard

The following instructions are for capturing trace from a running program

0. This [guide](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/pytorch-xla-performance-profiling-tpu-vm#tpu-vm) will
help you with the Cloud TPU setup with the required installations

1. Start a TensorBoard Server

>> tensorboard --logdir ./tensorboard --port 9001

You could view the TensorBoard output at http://localhost:9001 on your local machine, and then open the
``PROFILE`` plugin from the top right dropdown or open http://localhost:9001/#profile

2. Once the code you'd like to profile is running, click on ``CAPTURE PROFILE`` button. You could enter
``localhost:9012`` (default port for XLA Profiler) as the Profile Service URL. Then, you could enter
the number of milliseconds for the profiling duration, and click ``CAPTURE``

3. Make sure the code is running, while you are trying to capture the traces. Also, it would lead to better
performance insights if the profiling duration is longer than the step time

4. Once the capture is finished, the page will refresh and you could browse through the insights using the
``Tools`` dropdown at the top left
