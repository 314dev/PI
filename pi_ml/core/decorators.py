    Note:
        TPU's require weights to be tied/shared after moving the module to the device.
        Failure to do this results in the initialization of new weights which are not tied.
        To overcome this issue, weights should be tied using the ``on_post_move_to_device`` model hook
        which is called after the module has been moved to the device.
