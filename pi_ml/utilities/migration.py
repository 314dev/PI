    """Registers legacy artifacts (classes, methods, etc.) that were removed but still need to be included for
    unpickling old checkpoints. The following patches apply.

        1. ``pi_ml.utilities.argparse._gpus_arg_default``: Applies to all checkpoints saved prior to
           version 1.2.8. See: https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/6898
        2. ``pi_ml.utilities.argparse_utils``: A module that was deprecated in 1.2 and removed in 1.4,
           but still needs to be available for import for legacy checkpoints.

    Example:

        with pl_legacy_patch():
            torch.load("path/to/legacy/checkpoint.ckpt")
    """
